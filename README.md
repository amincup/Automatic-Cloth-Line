# Automatic-Cloth-Line
 We developed an Automatic Clothesline using nodemcu to address the inconvenience of lifting clothes during rain or absence. The system includes a rain sensor, servo for movement, and a light sensor for nighttime operation. The Android app, created in Android Studio, displays sensor and clothesline statuses for user convenience.
